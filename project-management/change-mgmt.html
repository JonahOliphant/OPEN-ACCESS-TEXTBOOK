      <h1><strong>CHANGE Management</strong> </h1>
      <p dir="ltr">A key component of scope management is being able to address how you will handle change requests.
        Some people consider change management (otherwise known in some circles as change control) to be a part of scope
        management, and in a way this is very true -- the better the job done in defining and communicating scope,
        likely the less need there will be for changes later on. However, in reality in my experience, changes are
        inevitable, and thus are worthy of their own discussion. What is change management? The management of change and
        development within a business or similar organization. In projects, we work hard to define the scope, the
        project requirements and specifications, as well as it's time frame and costs. A key success factor is pinning
        down the scope of what is to be done so as to not experience &quot;scope creep&quot; where a project never gets
        completed.&nbsp;<span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">Change management is concerned with ensuring that any
          changes that occur ar</span>e agreed upon, having a process in place to determine when change has occured, and
        managing actual changes when they do occur. <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">In management, here it is in a nutshell: A change control process needs to be put in place once the
        project baseline and scope has been set and agreed upon. Whatever you determine as your change control process
        needs to be put into place at the time of the scope baselines release--not later in the project. What you are
        trying to do is establish recognition of changes that may reduce or increase the project scope.&nbsp; This might
        be a form that has to be completed, a signature from a &quot;higher up&quot; that must be obtained, agreement by
        a committee, whatever. The most common is a Change Request Form that must be formally submitted and approved.
        Whatever you end up using, having something in place will deter or at least diminish &quot;<strong>scope
          creep</strong>&quot;, &quot;bleed&quot;, &quot;tackons&quot;, &quot;snowball effect&quot; -- whatever you want
        to call it that makes your project perpetually grow larger with no additional time or resources or clarification
        attached.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Change management is the planning, initiating, realizing, controlling, stabilizing, and sustaining of
        new or altered work activities at levels ranging from personal to corporate.&nbsp; Overall, the goal of change
        management is to enhance organizational relationships between all stakeholders. This may occur by introducing
        change in some cases and not introducing change in others.&nbsp; It involves considering areas of organizational
        management, industrial engineering, and psychology disciplines. With change management that are often ripple
        effects. Thus a question to ask is what will be impacted positively or negatively, what might be impacted, and
        how important the change is&nbsp; itself when considering these factors.&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">When implementing change it is important to realize that it is not just a rational fact-based
        process, it also is based on emotion and trust. Often change management is based at least in part on the quality
        of the relationship the change agent has with stakeholders. There needs to be support for the proposed change as
        well as practical work capability to accomplish it.&nbsp; Additionally, there has to be a commitment to its
        success which includes individuals taking responsibility for ensuring the change is incorporated
        permanently.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>Change Management Strategies</strong></h3>
      <p>There are multiple perspectives that can be taken when addressing change as well as in overall management
        practices. Considering the perspectives of yourself and your workplace may help in the change management process
        as it expresses how individuals and the environment are seen. Below are some perspectives that may come in to
        play: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Empirical-Rational - People are rational and will follow their self-interest — once it is revealed to them.
          Change is based on the communication of information and the proffering of incentives.</li>
        <li>Normative-Reeducative - People are social beings and will adhere to cultural norms and values. Change is
          based on redefining and reinterpreting existing norms and values, and developing commitments to new ones.</li>
        <li>Power-Coercive - People are basically compliant and will generally do what they are told or can be made to
          do. Change is based on the exercise of authority and the imposition of sanctions.</li>
        <li>Environmental-Adaptive - People oppose loss and disruption but they adapt readily to new circumstances.
          Change is based on building a new organization and gradually transferring people from the old one to the new
          one. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 dir="ltr">Why change sometimes fails </h3>
      <p dir="ltr">As with other transformational efforts, there are times when intended change does not go as planned.
        Below are some potential reasons for this occurring: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The sense of urgency or timeline is not understood or agreed upon</li>
        <li>There is no champion to guide the change through the project team</li>
        <li>The tasks and methods to implement the change&nbsp; are unclear</li>
        <li>Individuals have not been given the necessary empowerment to act on the change</li>
        <li>Consideration of the change in long-term integration was not adequately addresses</li>
        <li>There is lack of buy in for the change</li>
        <li>There is not ample resources or time given to implement the requested change</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 dir="ltr">Change Management Process</h3>
      <p>Having an agreed-upon change management process at every organization and for every project is critical. Is
        equally important to have a clear understanding of the decision-making paths and roles for change requests. It
        is quite possible that there will be different change management decision making processes for different change
        requests; those need to be clarified as well. It is not always the case that one-size-fits-all and it is not
        always the case that every decision needs the same level of authority to be made. These are things that should
        be addressed and understood before a project even begins. No matter what the change approval processes are, it
        is critical that a communication method is in place for all stakeholders. It is also highly suggested that there
        is a means for stakeholders to look up change request as desired and to see their status at any point during the
        project.</p>
      <p>At a minimum a change management process should include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">a change request is submitted</span></li>
        <li><span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">a individual or group of individuals must authorize the
            investigation of the change itself</span></li>
        <li><span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">the change request is evaluated for feasibility, impact on
            time/money/resources, necessity, etc (at a minimum should address cost, schedule and scope)</span></li>
        <li><span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">if approved then the change needs to be communicated to all
            affected parties and needs to be incorporated into the project plan</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">In a way, the change management process is sort of like a mini-project
          plan in itself. All of the things that must be done in planning a project must be done for project changes as
          well.</span> <span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">To have the process work requires that an individual
          submit information on the change to be considered. In most cases, anyone within the project team, user
          community, stakeholders, or contractors can submit a change request.</span></p>
      <h3>Change Request/Control Forms</h3>
      <p><span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">Often there is a form called a change request or change control form
          that is used to submit a change request. </span>This ensures consistency of information, all necessary
        information be provided, and a means of record-keeping all requests. </p>
      <p dir="ltr">While there are many types of change request forms that vary based on the platform or on the
        perceived information needs, there is some information that could be considered key from a requestor. These
        include the requestor name and department, some type of short title for the change request, a more thorough
        description of the change request, any applicable references or materials, a description of why the change is
        proposed, an impact statement if the change is or is not implemented, and any change alternatives that may have
        been considered.</p>
      <p>Once the change request is submitted, a review of the request process should begin. This process should include
        an Initial review that determines the viability of the request and if it should proceed, be modified, be
        rejected, or be deferred. Assuming the request proceeds onward, it should be followed with an impact analysis
        discussion. After the impact analysis, the request should again be reviewed and a decision made as to the status
        and priority. If the change requests precedes to implementation, the appropriate parties must be assigned any
        applicable tasks and the status update should be documented. In most cases change requests and outcomes are
        stored in a database. <span data-mce-style="font-size: small;">Below is a sample of such a database:</span></p>
