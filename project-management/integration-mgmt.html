    <h1><strong>Project Integration Management</strong></h1>
    <p>One thing a project manager needs to do is to make sure that the project is integrated into the workings of the business not only when it is being developed (allocation of resources and manpower to the project without negatively affecting the operations of the company or other projects) but also at completion by ensuring the project outcome actually does end up integrated into the business or business processes. A project integration manager basically makes certain every part of a project is coordinated. This coordination is not just within the project itself but within the larger context of the corporation. Within the project itself, integration ensures all processes are appropriately aligned and connected with other processes to facilitate coordination. In the larger context integration management ensures the project itself and steps needed are aligned and coordinated with the needs of the larger corporation.</p>
    <p>An important skill for this area of management is the ability to plan, record, manage, and report project information. One thing that should be done right up front is develop a project charter. A <strong>project charter</strong> is a document issued by senior management that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. It should be shared with everyone who may be affected (all stakeholders) so that everyone acknowledges the existence and importance of the project.
    After the project charter,&nbsp; other documents such as a project management plan, need to be created that ensure strong project integration. These are explained in the <a href="project-basics-planning.html" class="black">project planning chapter</a>.    </p>
    <p>When working out scheduling and required resources, communicate these needs clearly and to all persons potentially affected. If a project needs the one programmer on staff, for example, for a month in January, the team needs to be sure that upper management and other project managers/coordinators are aware of this need as it may affect other things the programmer is or could be working on. One also needs to make sure the programmer is actually available and not on vacation or otherwise. Next, a time commitment must be agreed upon and ensured, to the project cannot not become a lessor priority when the time actually arises. Through positive communication and expressing why this project is important to the company as a whole feelings of overbearance or controlling from the other parties can be avoided. To the degree possible the project should be seen as a benefit and a &quot;win&quot; by all involved.    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">Enterprise environmental factors play a role in integration management.&nbsp; <strong>Enterprise environmental factors</strong> refer to conditions that are not under the control of the project team that influence, constrain, or direct the project.&nbsp; Often, enterprise environmental factors are considered to be input in most planning processes that may enhance or constrain project management options and may have a positive or negative influence on the project's outcome. Integration management also ensures that any requested changes to a project are managed following a change management process.&nbsp;This is sometimes referred to as integrated change control. Again, enterprise environmental factors may play a role. To learn more about change management see the <a href="change-mgmt.html" class="black">change management chapter</a>.</p>
    When the project is actually close to completion (and throughout the project) make sure the project team is working on addressing how the project outcome will be integrated into the company and by whom. Make sure the people who need to know the details about the project know the details. For example, if a new super cool widget is being developed, then the sales people need to kknow all about it, and the marketing department should be putting processes in place to market it. Or if a new database feature is being implemented, all appropriate individuals must be trained and understand why the change in process is occurring. Inertia says that a body in straight line motion will be inclined to stay in motion in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force, this goes for human nature as well, we will keep doing what we have been doing unless we have a motivating reason not to.<br>
