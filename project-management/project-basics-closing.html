    <h1>Closing</h1>
    <p>Project closure is more than simply ending a project. It should be a coordinated activity that includes a discussion of lessons learned, documentation of those lessons learned as well as a means for using that information and future projects, a closure of contracts, and the release of employees who had been involved in a project to go and do other work. It should be noted that some companies see project closure as something that occurs at transition or milestone points, such as when a phase of construction is complete.  In all cases, project closure should occur at final acceptance of product and when all financial obligations closed. </p>
    <h2>Project Termination</h2>
    <p>Project termination is sometimes also called project close-out or final shutdown. During this phase the people involved are acknowledged for their achieved goals and the work is considered complete.</p>
    <p>First lets look at what a successful project is:    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The objectives of the project have been achieved to the full satisfaction of the users,</li>
      <li>All closeout activities have been completed, and</li>
      <li>All designated interests, including the project's sponsor and/or initiator officially accept the project results or products and close the project." (Wideman, n.d.)    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now let's consider why a project should be terminated. Projects usually are terminated for two basic reasons: project success or project failure. Senior managers must create a cultural setting that encourages projects to be successful, but also allows a project to fail if it has lost its strategic fit in the organization&rsquo;s plans for the future. All project terminations don't necessarily mean the project ended successfully. Either way though, there are some steps that should be taken.</p>
    <p>Steps to take in termination</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finalize all outstanding contracts to vendors, suppliers or customers including final payments (in some cases, according to federal regulations, project-related revenue that is earned on or before project termination is considered program income. If it is earned after project termination, it is an external sale.)</li>
      <li>Transfer any responsibilities necessary</li>
      <li>Reassign the project team members to other duties</li>
      <li>Release all remaining resources such as materials</li>
      <li>Complete the final accounting on the project such as totally final costs, paying bills, etc so you can "close the book"</li>
      <li>Document the results of the project and make recommendations for future projects (opportunity for learning and anticipating new risks)</li>
      <li>Presentation of the system and approval (or rejection) of the system by the client according to acceptance criteria set forth in the Project Agreement</li>
      <li>Installation and field testing as applicable</li>
    </ul>
