    <h1><strong>Flow Charts (also known as Process Flow Diagrams or Process Maps)</strong></h1>
    <p>A flow chart is process management in diagram form. It includes the steps in a process and their sequence. Below is an example from Wikimedia:  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SCOTUS_appointment_flowchart.svg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/process-management/256px-SCOTUS_appointment_flowchart.svg.png" alt="Basic flow chart example" width="256" height="311" id="107400915" data-id="108040469" data-api-endpoint="https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/530460/files/108040469" data-api-returntype="File" data-ally-work-around-alt="'256px-SCOTUS_appointment_flowchart.svg.png'"></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Flow charts help us map business processes. This in turn, helps us all understand and clarify processes. In some cases the flow charts are kept intentionally basic, while in other circumstances they can become highly complex. As Walsh-Kelly notes, "Two types of flow charts are utilized in quality improvement. A high-level flowchart, outlining 6-10 major steps, gives a high-level view of a process. These flowcharts display the major blocks of activity, or the major system components, in a process. These charts are especially useful in the early phases of a project and help to set priorities for improvement work. A detailed flowchart is a close-up view of the process, typically showing dozens of steps. These flowcharts make it easy to identify complexity, excessive steps, etc. in a process and should be used when you want to standardize or make changes in the process." (2015)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In creating a flow chart, there are some standard symbols that are used:</p>

    <p>You can right click to open a larger version of the standard symbols.

    <p>See a real life example of a flow chart that the author developed to help address and identifty process issues in the tenure process used at her institution. She used Excel so she could compare the process as written in policy to the process actually in place. Items in red italics were identified as being lacking in policy but necessary for the process to function: <a href="flowchart-tenure-v12.pdf" class="black">Tenure process flow chart (pdf)</a>    </p>
    <h2><strong>Guidance on Constructing Flow Charts</strong> </h2>
    <ol>
  
      <li>Identify the goal for creating the flowchart and the level of detail required-high or detailed.</li>
          <li>Assemble the people who know the process best and outline the process steps.</li>
          <li>Define the first and last steps in the process.</li>
          <li>Begin documenting the process steps in sequence. Some steps may be parallel-they happen at the same time. Describe the process as it really exists, not the ideal. </li>
          <li>Work through the entire process, showing actions and decisions appropriately in the order they occur. Link these together using arrows to show the flow of the process. (Tip: Self-adhesive notes are a flexible way to document steps, using one note for each step. This allows you to easily change the order or add new steps.)</li>
          <li>At decision symbols, choose the most natural branch and continue to the end.</li>
          <li>Use notes for unfamiliar steps and continue to the end.</li>
          <li>When you reach the last step, go back to fill in any branches.</li>
          <li>Follow up on unfamiliar steps and update chart.</li>
          <li>Validate your flow chart. Work from step to step asking yourself and others if you have<br>
            correctly represented the sequence of actions and decisions involved in the process.</li>
          <li>Identify areas for improvement and redesign the process. (Walsh-Kelly, 2015). </li>
        </ol>
   
    <h2><strong>Flowchart Analysis (Process)</strong></h2>
    <p>Not only can flow charts help us highlight areas for improvement in a business process caused by unnecessary steps, gaps, and barriers, they can also help us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li aria-level="1">identify attributes that indicate a backward loop in a business process</li>
      <li aria-level="1">select the appropriate steps for addressing handoffs</li>
      <li aria-level="1">understand and describe value-added procedures</li>
      <li aria-level="1">recommend ways to add value to business procedures</li>
      <li aria-level="1">standardize or redesign a process</li>
    </ul>
